# Description

This is a very simple script made in python to check if a Steam ID is available or not using your steam api key.

## Setup
Before you download:
1. Make sure you have python installed, if not download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Make sure you have requests installed.
## Running the script
1. Download the source code and edit the main.py file and then change `YOUR_STEAM_API_KEY` to your Steam API key which you can get [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
2. After that make sure you have put the IDs you want to check in the ```account_names``` txt file.
3. When you have done that open the terminal in the folder and write ```py main.py``` or ```py main.py > output.txt``` to get the results in a txt instead.
4. Profit!

### DO NOT SHARE YOUR API KEY WITH ANYONE!
